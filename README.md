AutoSULT R Package to Generate Problems and Solutions from the SULT

The target audience for this R package is students relatively early in the process of learning life contingencies and/or instructors of university courses covering life contingencies concepts.  It is not intended to be a tool for exam preparation for the SOA Exam LTAM (or other actuarial exams); rather, the goal is to generate problems and solutions covering basic, rudimentary types of actuarial life table calculations.

This package will automatically generate problems of certain specified types, based on the "Standard Ultimate Life Table"(SULT) or "Standard Ultimate Survival Model" (SUSM) currently used by the SOA Exam LTAM, and Actuarial Mathematics for Life Contingent Risks textbook, 2nd edition (AMLCR2e), respectively. The problems considered include 6 types of problems from Ch. 3 of AMLCR2e, 16 types of problems from Ch. 4 of AMLCR2e, and 13 types of problems from Ch. 5 of AMLCR2e.

This is a work in progress -- more types of problems (and improved documentation) are expected to be added.  Feedback and ideas for future improvements would be welcomed.
